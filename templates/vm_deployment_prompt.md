# VM Deployment and Services Implementation

## Chat Session Prompt Template

```
Hi! I'm working on implementing VM Deployment and Services for the braedenc/Trading-Bot repository.

Current setup:
- Repository: braedenc/Trading-Bot  
- Feature branch: feature/vm-deployment
- Goal: Create automated VM deployment and service management

Please help me:
1. Set up the feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/vm-deployment`
2. Implement comprehensive deployment infrastructure:
   - VM provisioning scripts (Terraform/Ansible)
   - Docker containerization for services
   - Service orchestration and management
   - Auto-scaling capabilities
   - Infrastructure monitoring
   - Backup and disaster recovery
3. Create deployment documentation and runbooks
4. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed

Key directories to work in:
- deployment/vm/ - VM scripts
- deployment/docker/ - Container configs
- deployment/terraform/ - Infrastructure as code

At the end, please create a session summary and push everything to the remote repository.
```

## Expected Deliverables
- VM provisioning automation
- Containerized services
- Infrastructure as code
- Deployment automation
- Monitoring setup
- Documentation and runbooks
