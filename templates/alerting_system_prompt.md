# Alerting and Notification System Implementation

## Chat Session Prompt Template

```
Hi! I'm working on implementing an Alerting and Notification System for the braedenc/Trading-Bot repository.

Current setup:
- Repository: braedenc/Trading-Bot  
- Feature branch: feature/alerting-system
- Goal: Create comprehensive alerting and notification capabilities

Please help me:
1. Set up the feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/alerting-system`
2. Implement a robust alerting system with:
   - Real-time monitoring and alerting
   - Multiple notification channels (email, SMS, Slack, Discord)
   - Alert severity levels and escalation
   - Custom alert rules and thresholds
   - Alert acknowledgment and resolution tracking
   - Dashboard for alert management
3. Create alert templates and notification workflows
4. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed

Key directories to work in:
- monitoring/alerts/ - Alert system
- monitoring/notifications/ - Notification handlers
- monitoring/dashboards/ - Alert dashboards

At the end, please create a session summary and push everything to the remote repository.
```

## Expected Deliverables
- Real-time monitoring system
- Multi-channel notifications
- Alert management interface
- Escalation workflows
- Alert analytics
- Comprehensive documentation
