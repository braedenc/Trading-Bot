## Chat Session Prompt Template

```
Hi! I'm working on implementing a CI/CD Pipeline with GitHub Actions for the braedenc/Trading-Bot repository.

Current setup:
- Repository: braedenc/Trading-Bot  
- Feature branch: feature/ci-cd-pipeline
- Goal: Create automated CI/CD pipeline for continuous integration and deployment

Please help me:
1. Set up the feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/ci-cd-pipeline`
2. Implement comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with:
   - Automated testing workflows
   - Code quality checks and linting
   - Security scanning
   - Automated deployment to staging/production
   - Environment promotion workflows
   - Rollback capabilities
   - Performance testing integration
3. Create deployment strategies and workflows
4. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed

Key directories to work in:
- .github/workflows/ - GitHub Actions workflows
- deployment/ - Deployment configurations
- tests/ - Test automation

At the end, please create a session summary and push everything to the remote repository.
```

## Expected Deliverables
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated testing pipeline
- Security and quality gates
- Deployment automation
- Environment management
- Monitoring integration
- Documentation
