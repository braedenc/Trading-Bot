## ⚠️ **IMPORTANT REMINDERS**

### Before Each Chat Session:
1. ✅ Start with: `./check_status.sh`
2. ✅ Use the appropriate setup script OR the full prompt above
3. ✅ Always create feature branches (never work on main)

### During Each Session:
1. ✅ Commit frequently: `git add . && git commit -m "progress update"`
2. ✅ Push regularly: `git push origin feature/[branch-name]`

### End Each Session:
1. ✅ Final commit: `git add . && git commit -m "Complete: [feature description]"`
2. ✅ Push to remote: `git push origin feature/[branch-name]`
3. ✅ Create session summary
4. ✅ Verify with: `./check_status.sh`

## 🔍 **Troubleshooting**

If you start a session and something seems wrong:
1. Run `./check_status.sh` immediately
2. Check for your feature branches: `git branch -r`
3. Look for session summaries: `find . -name "SESSION_SUMMARY_*"`

## 🎉 **Current Status**
- ✅ Repository is clean and up to date
- ✅ Version control infrastructure committed and pushed
- ✅ All templates and scripts ready
- ✅ Directory structure prepared
- ✅ Ready for 4 implementation sessions

**You're all set! Start your next chat session with one of the prompts above.**
